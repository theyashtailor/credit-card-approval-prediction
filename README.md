## Introduction
In the realm of financial services, accurately predicting credit card approval is crucial. This project applies logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines, and other sophisticated algorithms to analyze a dataset and predict approval outcomes based on demographic and financial data.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of 438,557 observations and 18 variables, including demographic, financial, and employment information. It has been sourced from public data repositories and is utilized to understand credit card approval dynamics better. Details on handling missing values, outliers, and feature selection are included in the [project report](https://github.com/theyashtailor/credit-card-approval-prediction/blob/main/Credit%20Card%20Approval%20prediction.pdf)

## Algorithms Used
- **Logistic Regression**: Used for its effectiveness in binary classification tasks.
- **Decision Trees**: Offers a visual interpretation of decision-making processes.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Utilized for its robustness in high-dimensional spaces.
- **Random Forest**: Chosen for its ability to handle overfitting and provide variable importance measures.

## Model Performance
The models were evaluated based on their accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and kappa scores. Performance metrics demonstrated the effectiveness of the models, with accuracies up to 85.17% and significant predictive capabilities.

## Conclusion

The Credit Card Approval Prediction project successfully applied various data mining techniques to analyze and predict credit card approvals based on demographic, financial, and behavioral attributes from a large dataset. The project utilized logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines, and random forest algorithms to create predictive models, each revealing different insights into the factors that influence credit approval decisions.

### Key findings include:
- **Income and Asset Ownership:** These emerged as primary factors in determining creditworthiness. Higher income levels and asset ownership, particularly car ownership, strongly correlated with increased likelihood of credit approval.
- **Demographic Influences:** Marital status, gender, and number of dependents were significant predictors, with married applicants and those with fewer dependents generally seeing higher approval rates.
- **Model Performance:** The models demonstrated robust predictive capabilities with accuracies up to 85.17%, high sensitivity, and specificity, indicating their effectiveness in classifying credit approval outcomes. 

The project underscored the potential of advanced machine learning techniques in enhancing the credit decision-making process, providing financial institutions with powerful tools to assess applicant creditworthiness more accurately. Future work could integrate additional predictive features such as credit history and employment status, and explore more advanced algorithms like gradient boosting to further refine the models and improve their predictive accuracy.

This conclusion highlights the project's achievements and potential areas for future research, providing a clear picture of how data mining techniques can be applied to solve complex problems in the financial sector.
