## Introduction
In the realm of financial services, accurately predicting credit card approval is crucial. This project applies logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines, and other sophisticated algorithms to analyze a dataset and predict approval outcomes based on demographic and financial data.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of 438,557 observations and 18 variables, including demographic, financial, and employment information. It has been sourced from public data repositories and is utilized to understand credit card approval dynamics better. Details on handling missing values, outliers, and feature selection are included in the [project report](https://github.com/theyashtailor/credit-card-approval-prediction/blob/main/Credit%20Card%20Approval%20prediction.pdf)

## Algorithms Used
- **Logistic Regression**: Used for its effectiveness in binary classification tasks.
- **Decision Trees**: Offers a visual interpretation of decision-making processes.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Utilized for its robustness in high-dimensional spaces.
- **Random Forest**: Chosen for its ability to handle overfitting and provide variable importance measures.

## Model Performance
The models were evaluated based on their accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and kappa scores. Performance metrics demonstrated the effectiveness of the models, with accuracies up to 85.17% and significant predictive capabilities.
